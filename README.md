# TO-DO
 * [ ] Write a better readme.md
	* [x] Like install instructions etc.
	* [ ] Maybe some usage instructions too ?
 * [x] Get rid of loader.ps1 & SwatchBar\Loader.ini
 * [x] Move settings.ini inc files to @Resources
 * [ ] Figure out if distributing Cubano is legal or not, its included in my Adobe subscription. "Includes usage in both personal and commercial projects"
 * [x] Comment the code for once
 * [ ] Move the plus/minus +/- signs in settings.inc around the option.
	* Like this: - WIDTH + 
 * [x] Test if relative addresses work for github readme.md 
	* Hey it works :D
 * [ ] Revise instructions.inc
 * [x] Move alignment.inc MouseActions to bangs.inc
    * Used a MeterStyle, they work better
